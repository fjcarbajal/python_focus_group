# python_focus_group
Following LaSalle's lab python information

See below the copy and pasted information
This repository is for the LaSalle Lab Python Focus Group, where we are learning how to code using Python.

## Session_01
foo.txt: A file containing random phrases that was created using `touch`
bar.txt: A file containing random phases that was created using `nano`
git_test.txt: An empty file created to practice pushing files to GitHub

## Session _02
NA; worked on UNIX commands only

## Session_03
hello_world.py: A Python script that prints "Hello, World!" when run

## Session_04
comments.py: python script edited through Notepad++
comments_old.py: ignore this file, it was edited using nano function and not Notepad++
variables.py: python script used to understand the importance of variables and variable names in python - very similar as with R

## Session_05
strings.py: an introduction into strings (text types) with Python

## Session_06
Come back here for indexing review
more_strings.py: learning about different ways to format strings, the best way is f-strings
The above file also has notes on string operations
extra_practice.py: a file to go through the extra practice problems


## Session_07
Focused on numeric types (Integers, Floats, and Complexes)
complex_math.py:Introduction of using "math" module 
espression.py: how to perform math operations
numeric_types.py: integers, floats, complexes
type_casting.py: how to convert data types

## Session_08
Focuses on Sequence Types (Tuples, Lists, and Ranges)
tuples.py: goes into how they can't be changed but we can transform them into lists to be able to manipulate them
lists.py: Lists are super useful, and probably one of the most powerful data types you can use in Python 
ranges.py: Ranges follow similar formatting to indexes, but be mindful of how indexes and ranges work. In general, the syntax is (first number in range, last number in range + 1, every Xth value)

## Session_09
dictionaries.py: Dictionaries are a type of collection in Python
set_types.py: Set types do not have an order, you can't use indexs, not as useful unlike lists
booleans.py: Any logical operator or statement will produce a Boolean (True/False) output


## Session_10
data_types.py: a script with different data types to be familiar with
for_loops.py: remember for loops as "for every item, do this action" You can have basic, nested, parallel for loops, and even set for dictionaries
while_loops.py: similar to for loops but the loop will run only if a condition is met. Be careful to not get stuck in a never ending while loop

## Session_11
conditionals.py: Conditionals are if-else statements but the else part does not always need to be there
There are many ways to set up conditionals: if-else statements, including "elif" as adding "else if," and including "and" or "or."

## Session_12
functions.py: You can create functions, set defaults, prep recursive, and add descriptions to the function.

## Session_13
smiley_argparse.py: a module that lets you incorporate input from command line to determine how the python script will run
argparse-template.py: a template with required and optional arguments, and switches

## Session_14
screen is a tool that lets me "switch between tabs/tasks" without losing my place
You can essentially have code running in one screen while you are doing something else in a separate screen
TIP: Name your screens based on projects or idicators so you know what is running or what you were focused on in that screen
screen_cheat_sheet.py: a simple cheat sheet when I need to navigate screen
