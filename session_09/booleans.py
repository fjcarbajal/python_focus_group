#Conditionals are one of the most important aspects of coding
# A Boolean can take on one of two values: True or False

#When Boolean have a numeric value, 1 is True, and 0 is False

# Demonstrate Boolean as integer

# Demonstrate Boolean as float
bool4 = float(True)

# Compare letters
print("A" > "B")

'''
Other Operations to know of
==	equal (since only one = is a variable assignment)
!=	not equal
is	object identity
is not	negated object identity
'''

'''
Logic Operators
"not" "or" "and" all take two values to produce a new Boolean value
You can also use "if, and" or "if, or"
Including "not" in a statement outputs the opposite of the actual value
'''

# Basic logic operators
print(not(True))
print(not(False))

# Using logic operators in a basic conditional
