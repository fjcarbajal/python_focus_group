"""
Python does not have a command for declaring a variable. The variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it using the assignment operator: =
You can assign any data type to a variable (we will talk more about data types later)
Variable names should not contain any spaces (spaces are usually replaced with underscores, which is the case with the variable: pet_names)
Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character (a variable name cannot star with a number)
Variable names can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
Variables are case-sensitive (a and A are different variables)
